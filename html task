    I am someone that really admires cute puppies but what i didn't imagine is the headache they can become when they start growing older

</P>

    I have always wanted to have a dog ever since i was 15 i guess, be it a security dog or just any dog because i'm like an introvert. I got a dog as a gift from my brother <em>even after my mom refused to harbor a dog in her house becaused we're muslims</em>. He was about 3 months old when we got him and i decided to name him <strong>LEO</strong>. He's an American Eskimo <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dogbreedinfo.com%2Fhybridcrossbreeds%2Famericaneskimomixdogs.htm&psig=AOvVaw2BApABoIqzLwBonB5vyEdK&ust=1614001538014000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCPj4nLWO--4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD">but half breed</a>
